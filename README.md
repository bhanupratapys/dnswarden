# Notice

## DNSWarden now supports DNS-over-QUIC including the custom filter DNS

## [Custom filter](https://dnswarden.com/customfilter.html) DNS is live, try it out [here](https://dnswarden.com/customfilter.html).

### Just a normal privacy oriented DNS service with the ability to block ads, trackers, malware, and phishing. We provide an uncensored DNS aswell

## Features

* Provides multiple types of DNS 
  * **Pure uncensored DNS** (Blocks nothings , more power for the user!)
  * **Adblocking DNS** (Blocks ads , trackers and all the random crap on the internet.)
  * **Adult Filter DNS** (Blocks adult content, enforces force safe search for search engines and YouTube. Also blocks ads, trackers and other malicious stuff)
  * **Custom filter DNS** (Users can choose multiple blocklists from the predefined set depending on their usage. Supports DNS-over-QUIC, DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS)
  
    * Supports DNS over QUIC, DNS over HTTPS, DNS over TLS and DNSCrypt.
    * DNSSEC and [QNAME minimization](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7816) are enabled by default.
    * Supports other [non-icann TLD's](https://github.com/bhanupratapys/dnswarden/issues/7#issuecomment-548266343).
    * No query logging .
    * If your favourite website gets blocked/broken, report **[here](https://github.com/dnswarden/blocklist-staging)** or **[here](https://t.me/dnswarden)** or **[here](mailto:dns-support@dnswarden.com)**. No support will be given to custom filter DNS for broken/blocked sites. Users will have to choose the blocklist appropriately.
